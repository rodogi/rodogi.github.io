      <title>Gene co-expression in breast cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this study, we used a multilayer network approach to uncover fundamental structural principles in gene co-expression networks (GCNs) that are disrupted in breast cancer. By analyzing both healthy and cancerous gene co-expression networks, we identified key differences in connectivity patterns, revealing how healthy cells maintain a complex network of gene interactions across chromosomes. In contrast, the breast cancer network exhibits a loss of these inter-chromosomal connections, leading to a simpler, more localized structure confined largely to genes within the same chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project looks into the structural and functional shifts in proteins caused by mutations, exploring how such changes impact protein behavior. By constructing detailed amino acid networks for five proteins, we analyzed how mutations at specific positions alter both structure and function, revealing a strong relationship between structural sensitivity and functional outcomes. Our approach combines network science with protein modeling, allowing us to predict functionally sensitive regions based solely on structural perturbations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
