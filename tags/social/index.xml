      <title>AI and Scientific Knowledge</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming tools for scientific information retrieval, yet their ability to recognize scientists and their contributions is far from uniform. In this work, we audit how three leading LLMs—GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5 Pro—recognize over 100,000 physicists across the productivity spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our analysis reveals systematic disparities: LLMs are significantly better at recognizing male scientists and those affiliated with Western institutions, mirroring and amplifying existing biases in scientific visibility. We trace these gaps in part to Wikipedia, which serves as a key training source and exhibits similar patterns of coverage inequality. The findings highlight that as LLMs become embedded in scientific workflows—from literature search to peer review—they risk reinforcing the unequal recognition structures already present in academia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Inspirational Cohorts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What makes certain groups of people catalyze disproportionate creative or scientific output? This project, funded by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.templeton.org/grant/inspirational-cohorts-and-the-science-of-purpose&#34; &#xA;  &#xA;   target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34; &#xA;&gt;John Templeton Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, takes a data-driven approach to identifying and understanding inspirational cohorts—clusters of individuals whose collective interactions spark transformative ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Combining network science, natural language processing, and large language models, the project pursues three interconnected goals: (1) mapping the structure and dynamics of inspirational communities across history, (2) understanding how cultural and institutional contexts shape the emergence of these cohorts, and (3) applying the Science of Purpose framework to uncover how shared purpose drives collective achievement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Biobanks</title>

      <guid>https://rodogi.github.io/research/biobanks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Biobanks—large repositories of biological samples and associated health data—are fundamental to modern biomedical research, yet their contributions are poorly captured by traditional metrics. In this work, we systematically traced over 2,600 biobanks across nearly 230,000 documents, including scientific publications, patents, clinical trials, grants, and policy reports, to map the full scope of their influence on science and public health.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We introduced the Biobank Impact Factor (BIF), a multidimensional metric that goes beyond citation counts to quantify a biobank’s reach. The BIF integrates factors such as the diversity of diseases studied, translational footprint, and intensity of collaborative use. Our analysis shows that biobanks offering open access to external researchers and maintaining rich, longitudinal datasets linked to medical records tend to have significantly greater scientific impact.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>BioTools</title>
      <link>https://rodogi.github.io/research/biotools/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Biomedical tools—laboratory methods, modeling techniques, and software applications—are essential to scientific discovery, from detecting genetic variants to visualizing molecular structures. Despite their critical role, these tools are frequently overlooked by traditional impact metrics such as citation counts, leaving a significant gap in recognizing the scientists and teams behind these innovations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To address this, our &lt;a href=&#34;https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/11120817&#34; &#xA;  &#xA;   target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34; &#xA;&gt;NIH-funded project&lt;/a&gt; establishes a comprehensive knowledge base, BioToolKB, that captures and categorizes the spectrum of BioTools used across biomedicine. By building a large, searchable repository linked to scientific publications, patents, clinical trials, and policy documents, we trace each tool’s reach and influence across science, policy, and clinical practice. We also develop new metrics that go beyond traditional indicators to capture BioTools’ contributions across sectors and their influence on disease research and treatment advancements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Venue Effect</title>
      <link>https://rodogi.github.io/research/venue/</link>

      <guid>https://rodogi.github.io/research/venue/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prominent venues—top journals in science, major biennials in art—act as gatekeepers that shape career trajectories. But who actually benefits from gaining access to these platforms? In this work, we reconstruct the full careers of 3.4 million scientists across physics, chemistry, biology, and sociology, alongside visual and performing artists, to quantify the causal impact of venue access on downstream career outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using heterogeneous difference-in-differences analysis, we document a statistically significant and long-lasting venue effect in both science and the arts, and show that it is a relatively recent phenomenon—becoming a prominent force only after the 1990s. Critically, the benefits of venue access are neither universal nor equitable: they are modulated by career stage, gender, and geography.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
