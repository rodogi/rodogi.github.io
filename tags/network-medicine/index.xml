      <description>&lt;p&gt;Network medicine views diseases as localized disruptions in networks of genes, proteins, and other molecular entities, offering a framework to understand how biological systems communicate and fail. NetMedPy is an open-source Python package that streamlines large-scale network medicine analyses, enabling researchers to evaluate network localization, compute proximity and separation between biological entities, and screen thousands of drug–disease pairs efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The package extends traditional approaches by providing four built-in distance metrics (shortest paths, random walk, biased random walk, and communicability) and four null models (degree match, degree logarithmic binning, strength logarithmic binning, and uniform), while also supporting user-defined custom metrics. By leveraging precomputed distance matrices, NetMedPy optimizes calculations for large interactomes, making network medicine screening practical at scale.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
