      <title>AI and Scientific Knowledge</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming tools for scientific information retrieval, yet their ability to recognize scientists and their contributions is far from uniform. In this work, we audit how three leading LLMs—GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5 Pro—recognize over 100,000 physicists across the productivity spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our analysis reveals systematic disparities: LLMs are significantly better at recognizing male scientists and those affiliated with Western institutions, mirroring and amplifying existing biases in scientific visibility. We trace these gaps in part to Wikipedia, which serves as a key training source and exhibits similar patterns of coverage inequality. The findings highlight that as LLMs become embedded in scientific workflows—from literature search to peer review—they risk reinforcing the unequal recognition structures already present in academia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What makes certain groups of people catalyze disproportionate creative or scientific output? This project, funded by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.templeton.org/grant/inspirational-cohorts-and-the-science-of-purpose&#34; &#xA;  &#xA;   target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer noopener&#34; &#xA;&gt;John Templeton Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, takes a data-driven approach to identifying and understanding inspirational cohorts—clusters of individuals whose collective interactions spark transformative ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Combining network science, natural language processing, and large language models, the project pursues three interconnected goals: (1) mapping the structure and dynamics of inspirational communities across history, (2) understanding how cultural and institutional contexts shape the emergence of these cohorts, and (3) applying the Science of Purpose framework to uncover how shared purpose drives collective achievement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Biobanks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Biobanks—large repositories of biological samples and associated health data—are fundamental to modern biomedical research, yet their contributions are poorly captured by traditional metrics. In this work, we systematically traced over 2,600 biobanks across nearly 230,000 documents, including scientific publications, patents, clinical trials, grants, and policy reports, to map the full scope of their influence on science and public health.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We introduced the Biobank Impact Factor (BIF), a multidimensional metric that goes beyond citation counts to quantify a biobank’s reach. The BIF integrates factors such as the diversity of diseases studied, translational footprint, and intensity of collaborative use. Our analysis shows that biobanks offering open access to external researchers and maintaining rich, longitudinal datasets linked to medical records tend to have significantly greater scientific impact.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
